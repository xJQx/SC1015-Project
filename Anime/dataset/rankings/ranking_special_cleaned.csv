The Minai clan of Mushishi were born from those who stopped this malevolent force, their members bound by duty to serve as retainers to the Karibusa family, within whom the Mushi remains sealed. The Mushishi Ginko is given a job request from Tanyuu Karibusa: oversee the work of the head of the Minai clan, Kumado Minai, in investigating an abandoned village where dead wood and even houses spring back to life as flourishing plants.

Though the Minai clan are oddly ruthless among Mushishi, even more peculiar is their widespread dull character, with little appreciation for beauty or sentiment. Tanyuu believes there is more to this trend than meets the eye. Ginko aims to answer her curiosity as he follows Kumado into a ""Path of Thorns,"" a place where Mushi flow from their own strange sources into the world of the living. Rare and deadly varieties of Mushi lurk in these depths, along with the secret nature of the Minai clan's resolve to their ancient task.

Doctor Yukinari Ookido has dedicated his life to studying these fascinating beings, that can be caught, trained, traded, and battled against each other. There's only so much he can do from his lab though. With this in mind, Ookido entrusts two young boys with a Pokémon of their own and a computerized encyclopedia to catalog them. One of them, Green, is brash, passionate, slightly arrogant, and Doctor Ookido's own nephew. The other boy, Red, is equally passionate, and filled with a wide-eyed, mildly naive sense of wonder.

Pokémon: The Origin follows Red in his journey through the region of Kanto in his attempt to complete his ""Pokédex"" by capturing and cataloging all the Pokémon that exist. Along the way he'll discover there's more to himself and his goals than he originally thought. Red will have to put both himself and his Pokémon to the test in special Gyms whose leaders are steps along the way to the Pokémon League, in order to challenge the Elite Four and become a Pokémon League Champion.

Aside from his goals to become a Champion, Red has other problems brewing. There are others who capture and train Pokémon for more sinister reasons, with the infamous criminal organization Team Rocket being one of them. If Red can defeat them, fellow trainers, his rival Green, and wild Pokémon all through Kanto, he just may fulfill his own dream, and Doctor Ookido's as well.",7.73,997,916,207597,141170,white,special,finished_airing,"[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Action'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Adventure'}, {'id': 4, 'name': 'Comedy'}, {'id': 10, 'name': 'Fantasy'}, {'id': 15, 'name': 'Kids'}]",4,game,1299,pg,"[{'id': 10, 'name': 'Production I.G'}, {'id': 27, 'name': 'Xebec'}, {'id': 28, 'name': 'OLM'}]",67,,,2013.0,fall,3221.0,188692.0,1587.0,1132.0,13017.0,207649.0,0.9869,0.0131

The tower looks like something out of a dream, but the breathtaking construction is unmistakably real. Intrigued, the traveling partners Kino and Hermes—the talking motorcycle—journey to the tower to get a closer look at the building.

Despite already being unbelievably tall, the tower is still being built by the townspeople to this day. Puzzled by the origins of the tower, Kino and Hermes ask around the town for information, but they fail to obtain any definitive answer. They continue to observe both the tower and the townspeople during their stay, hoping to understand the reasoning behind building a tower that requires so much effort. After all, there is always something to learn... even from the strangest of countries.

And so, a special unit—the dragon dentists—has the important duty of caring for the dragon's teeth.

Nonoko Kishii was the only one of many brave volunteers who survived a recent round of recruitment; in order to join the dragon dentists, one has to witness their future demise and accept it without a fight. Knowing the exact circumstances of their fated ends, the dragon dentists devote themselves to their work. One day, they gain a new member who did not undergo the test: Bernard ""Bel"" Octavius, a young enemy officer killed by his own men and revived by the dragon's teeth. Despite his appearance being an omen of a great disaster, he is placed under the care of Nonoko as a dentist-in-training. Will Bel come around to the dragon dentists' attitudes toward death and help them face the painful future that is to come?

One night they have an adventure in which they fly into the forest with many other cat-based vehicles, including many buses and trains. There they meet Totoro and many similar spirits, all heading for a gigantic catliner. This liner cruises off into the sky and the kittenbus takes Mei home.

These episodes are in fact a complete recap of all 50 episodes of the TV series and were first shown on television in Japan. The special edition episodes feature some new scenes and tweaks to previously animated scenes. The first special, The Empty Battlefield, which compiled episodes 1–21 of the series, was aired in two parts on Japanese TV in March 2004, followed by the next special, The Far-Away Dawn, which was episodes 22–40, in July 2004. The final special, The Rumbling Sky, which was episodes 41–50. While the story is overall unchanged, there are a few minor changes. In addition, several scenes are re-animated and re-dubbed.

Seishun's Shuusuke Fuji asks his younger brother Yuuta to go shopping with him to pick out a present for their older sister's birthday. As they proceed with their plans, Yuuta's teammates from the St. Rudolph Academy tennis team catch a glimpse of the two brothers and initially think nothing of it. However, St. Rudolph's manager, Hajime Mizuki, misinterprets the situation and believes Shuusuke is trying to get Yuuta to transfer back to Seishun. In an effort to stop his plans, Hajime forces the team to secretly follow the brothers around.

Initial A
Rikkai University-Affiliated Middle School's Akaya Kirihara always seems to get himself into sticky situations. Out on a shopping trip with Bunta Marui and Jackal Kuwahara, Kirihara bumps into Seishun's Takashi Kawamura, causing a stuffed toy Kawamura was carrying to go flying into a nearby dog's mouth. The two begin to chase the dog in order to get the toy back. Kawamura later recounts the story to Yamabuki Middle School's Jin Akutsu, who seems less than enthused about the ordeal.

Kai☆Para
Seishun's Eiji Kikumaru shows up to morning tennis practice tired after staying up late at night to play Kai☆Para, a new online game. Vice-captain Shuichirou Oishi seems perplexed by the concept of an online game, which shocks his teammates.

After coming to afternoon practice late, Hyoutei Academy's Choutarou Ootori accidentally overhears the team's third years discussing who will become the captain once they graduate. Ootori's doubles partner, Ryou Shishido, states that between him and Wakashi Hiyoshi, he would choose Hiyoshi to lead Hyoutei. This upsets Ootori greatly and the two end up fighting during practice. In an effort to cool down, Shishido sets out to train on his own but runs into Seishun's Kaoru Kaidou, who offers his two cents on his situation.

Docchi no Megane Show (Whose Glasses Are These?)
After knocking over a display stand, Higa Middle School's Yuujirou Kai bumps into Hyoutei's Hiyoshi, knocking his contact right out of his eye. As Hiyoshi searches for his missing contact, his teammate Yuushi Oshitari and Seishun's Sadaharu Inui begin to argue over what type of glasses would best suit him.

Seishun's Ryouma Echizen and Takeshi Momoshiro are invited by Rikkai's Genichirou Sanada to their school's Ocean Festival. The tennis team is putting on a ""Cinderella"" play for the festival with Kirihara playing the main role, though the second-year ace is reluctant to be wearing a frilly pink dress for the part.

Based on a seinen manga by Shinobu Ohtaka, serialized in Young Gangan.

Koushi Inuzuka is a smart high school student who aims to become a public prosecutor. Unfortunately for our good guy, he was born into a martial arts family whose head (ie his father) only knows one language: violence. When Koushi was still a baby, his father made a pact with his biggest rival to marry Koushi to his opponent-turned-friend's daughter. The union of the two blood lines is supposed to bring forth Earth's strongest martial arts clan.

Skip forward: Koushi is in high school, oblivious to the marriage arranged for him at his birth. Enter Momoko Kuzuryuu: sugar bomb, airhead, loli martial arts artist and Koushi's self-proclaimed bride (the strongest on Earth, no less). Her wish for sexual intercourse meets with Koushi's square refusal as he has absolutely no desire to get it on with someone who looks like she could be his little sister, not to mention that he doesn't have the foggiest idea who she actually is.

Meanwhile, a war has broken out between the martial arts families. For Koushi, this means that numerous fighters are out to challenge him. As if that weren't bad enough, our protagonist also has a fight phobia due to a traumatic incident that took place in his childhood. Now it's up to Momoko and her superhuman fighting skills to protect her ""husband."" Will the two sweethearts survive the trials and tribulations ahead of them? More importantly, will Momoko get her way receiving a baby from Koushi?",6.91,4203,5151,11650,5369,white,special,finished_airing,"[{'id': 4, 'name': 'Comedy'}, {'id': 9, 'name': 'Ecchi'}, {'id': 17, 'name': 'Martial Arts'}, {'id': 22, 'name': 'Romance'}]",2,manga,1380,pg_13,"[{'id': 101, 'name': 'Studio Hibari'}]",495,,,2007.0,summer,316.0,7948.0,199.0,128.0,3065.0,11656.0,0.9719,0.0281
