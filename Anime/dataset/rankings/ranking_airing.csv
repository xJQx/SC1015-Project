Under the guidance of the Beast Titan, Zeke, Eren takes extreme measures to end the ancient conflict between Marley and Eldia—but his true intentions remain a mystery. Delving deep into his family's past, Eren fights to control his own destiny.

Meanwhile, the long-feuding nations of Marley and Eldia utilize both soldiers and Titans in a brutal race to eliminate the other. Reiner Braun uses his own powers in a desperate bid to hold off Eren's own militaristic force, and his fellow Eldians—children Falco Grice and Gabi Braun—struggle to survive in the unfolding chaos.

Elsewhere, Eren's childhood friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert remain imprisoned alongside Eren's former Survey Corps companions, all disturbed by Eren's monstrous transformation. Under the blind belief that Eren still secretly harbors good intentions, Mikasa and the others enter the fray in an attempt to save their friend's very soul.

When a chance encounter with a shadow creature should have left him traumatized, it instead makes him believe that he has found a friend amidst those who only choose to notice his shortcomings.

Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.

Three years later, Hiyori's mother decides to remarry and arranges a dinner with her fiancé, his daughter, and Hiyori to celebrate. Anxious and wanting to pass the time, Hiyori goes to her usual fishing spot when a rather energetic girl named Koharu Minagi suddenly appears before her. The two soon become acquainted, with Koharu taking an interest in fly fishing herself. However, their meeting is more than just a coincidence: Koharu turns out to be Hiyori's future stepsibling, which is only the beginning of treasured memories the both of them will reel in as they foster their sisterhood.

Noticing the other trainers' tactics, Satoshi has his partner, Pikachu, strike Lugia with a Thunderbolt attack. Unfazed, Lugia flees, but not before Satoshi determinedly leaps onto its back. To Satoshi's surprise, he meets another boy, Gou, who leapt onto Lugia's back as well. The two ride on Lugia's back as it brings them along on a bizarre adventure across the seas. As it lets the two back on the ground, Satoshi and Gou bid their farewells to Lugia and return to Sakuragi Institute.

Impressed by Gou's findings and Satoshi's insight taken during their encounter, Sakuragi requests for the duo to be his new research partners. And so the duo's journey begins, traveling across multiple regions to meet many new Pokémon—including ones that have the ability to Gigantamax!

According to the rumors, several people have fallen victim to these specters. Those fortunate to survive their encounters with the paranormal beings claim that they resembled glitched holograms.

Hazakura Academy middle school student Hiro Amanokawa believes these sightings are merely an urban legend. However, as the incidents start to increase in frequency, he is reminded of the day his father suddenly vanished, with strange digital watches serving as the only relics of his disappearance. Much like the other sightings, what happened to Hiro's father cannot be explained by conventional logic. 

One day, when a fellow student in the academy is attacked by a Hologram Ghost, Hiro and his friend Kiyoshirou Higashimitarai decide to look into the matter. Little does Hiro know that this investigation will be their first step toward discovering a dangerous world previously unknown to mankind.

When Mirai experiences the marvel of his new powers firsthand, he gets a taste of the freedom that was locked away from him for so long. Armed with Nasse's gifts, Mirai is flung into a showdown with 12 other individuals, one of which will be chosen to become the next God. In stark contrast to when he wanted to end his life, Mirai is now prepared to do whatever it takes to protect his bleak chance at happiness, lest it be wrenched from his grasp forever.

But when their latest assailants turn out to be humans, the group is left dumbfounded. The mystery only deepens when they encounter a wandering priest, Hazel Grouse, and his imposing bodyguard, Gaty Nene Hawk. The pair hails from the far West, with Hazel using his powers of resurrection to aid grief-stricken villages. While his ability is greatly welcomed by the people, the truth behind it is less miraculous than it seems. Furthermore, the resurrected humans gain golden eyes, a trait they share with the group's recent attackers. It appears that the friendly priest's intentions are not as generous as one might expect—and the Sanzou party is a step away from unraveling them.

Despite his overwhelming power, he is unsatisfied with his abilities and desires to possess the mark suitable for close combat. Knowing that a person's crest is unchangeable, Gaius decides to reincarnate far into the future, hoping to alter his fate.

Thousands of years later, Gaius is reborn as Mathias Hildesheimer, successfully obtaining his long-coveted crest. However, he is surprised to learn that in these times, magic has vastly waned, and the techniques that were once widely used are now nothing more than just a speck of legend. Moreover, the crest that he painstakingly strived to attain is now considered the weakest—merely dubbed the ""Crest of Failure.""

Nevertheless, Mathias naturally exceeds all expectations. He enrolls into the royal capital's Second Academy, acing every trial that comes his way. But soon after, Mathias discovers the dark truth behind humanity's downfall into magical mediocrity—demons—and endeavors to remedy the consequence of his millennia-long absence once and for all.

This is all due to the efforts of the Allied Shinobi Forces and the village's Seventh Hokage, Naruto Uzumaki. Now resembling a modern metropolis, Konohagakure has changed, particularly the life of a shinobi. Under the watchful eye of Naruto and his old comrades, a new generation of shinobi has stepped up to learn the ways of the ninja.

Boruto Uzumaki is often the center of attention as the son of the Seventh Hokage. Despite having inherited Naruto's boisterous and stubborn demeanor, Boruto is considered a prodigy and is able to unleash his potential with the help of supportive friends and family. Unfortunately, this has only worsened his arrogance and his desire to surpass Naruto which, along with his father's busy lifestyle, has strained their relationship. However, a sinister force brewing within the village may threaten Boruto's carefree life.

New friends and familiar faces join Boruto as a new story begins in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations.

These creatures can possess humans and turn them into horrifying demons, thus bringing about more deaths and miasma and spinning a vicious cycle that inflicts further despair upon the land.

As a countermeasure, the immortal deities known as the ""Tianyuan"" select certain individuals to be ""Hunters."" Accompanying them are the ""Guizhan,"" specialists created by the Tianyuan who can absorb miasma and transform into demons themselves, acting as indispensable weapons against the wangliang.

After a tragic accident involving an out-of-control Guizhan causes the disbandment of the Sixth Hunter Unit, the Tianyuan designate three promising Hunters—namely Ji Ying, Qiao Xun, and Yan Ding—to reform the group. However, for an unknown reason, the Tianyuan also appoint Xiao Ling—the young Guizhan responsible for the former unit's downfall—to fight alongside the trio. Despite growing tensions, the members of the revived team must settle their differences and collectively use their abilities to attain victory against the common enemy.

Iris Thea Eaderlindt, an elven princess known for her open-mindedness and friendly attitude towards humans, is transferred to the Ark Metropolitan Academy. Coincidentally, her new teacher has been selected as her mating partner. Anxious yet determined to fulfill her duty of securing the future of her race, she starts partaking in sexual activities with him. To her surprise, Iris discovers that her partner's ancestors were orcs, well known for their extraordinary sexual prowess.

As more demi-human students join the class and find out about their teacher's ""side job,"" it becomes increasingly difficult for Iris to keep her partner's attention solely on her.

Located at the west of the Serenus continent, it's the city of lust and depravation, the ""Cuntry"" Negramstia.

More than a hundred years after its foundation, this country has now reached the peak of prosperity and decadence. Posessing an overwhelming ""charm"" power, the great adulteress empress Radomira rules over Negramstia with her powers. The empress pass her days indulging in pleasure and in the neighboring countries ""people hunts"" are performed as a pleasure tribute, opening a chain of pillage and tragedy.

Meanwhile, many countries that won't stand such inmorality any longer, unite and name themselves as the ""Holly Alliance"" to stand up against Negramstia. The force of the allied army overwhelm the Cuntry, and they manage to successfully corner Negramstia in an encirclement.

But before the allied army stood one man. The one rumored to be the second coming of the founding father the ""King Mercenary"" Vult, the Black Dogs Knights' captain Direc Rond. Following Radomira's order, he pursues the allied army surrounding the Cuntry to destroy them but, the real ambition in Direc's heart is to ""take over the throne"". Not only aiming for the beatiful maidens of the allied army, but also empress Radomira, in order to obtain everything, Direc ignites his ambition.
