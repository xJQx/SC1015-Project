# Project AniFame
The cost of producing an anime is very high, so it is important to know whether the anime that a studio is producing will be profitable, hence allowing studios to maximise their profits and ensure their survivability in the industry.

This project aims to maximize studiosâ€™ profits on anime they produce. We use MyAnimeList API to scrap anime from 2000 to 2021, clean and process it for Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

## 1. Data Collection
Dataset used:
- Animes from 2000 to 2021 scraped from MyAnimeList.net [API](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig/references/api/v2)

## 2. Data Cleaning
#### Missing Values
Fill the NaN entries with domain specific knowledge

#### Json Manipulation
Convert features into Json format for manipulation and feature generation

#### Feature Engineering
1. Aggregate individual individual viewing statistics into `positive_viewership_fraction` and `negative_viewership_fraction`
    - `positive_viewership_fraction` = (`statistics_watching` + `statistics_completed` + `statistics_plan_to_watch`) / `total_views`
    - `negative_viewership_fraction` = (`statistics_on_hold` + `statistics_dropped`) / `total_views`
2. Create feature `success`, for animes with:
    - `rank` <= 500
    - `popularity` <= 500
    - `mean` >=8.5
    - `positive_viewership_fraction` >= 0.975

#### Time Series
Create `genres` time-series since `genres` are obvious differences between animes

#### One-hot Encoding
One-hot encoding of categorical features for building machine learning models

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
